' ² Compare thio Paffage with another in the Close of the 16th ’
Chapter, where our Author, incommending Gicero's Foreirght, says,
Prudentianr quodammodo affl divinationem. llam very inclinabie to
think , that Divinatio here io a false Reading for Divinitas, which iix
the only Salvo 1 believe can be found for our Author. ' Perhaps some
ignorant Person, finding the two Paffagee something¹ ohim, has
pretended to correi} the former by the latter, which Correfflooit'
latr got into all the Copies. It io‘plain the Text, according to the -
present Reading is Nonsense. There is no Marmor of Affinity or

ness· betwixt Divinatio in that Senie, and the hnalterableGoodneso
of iiunranity in Atticus, which the Author is here commending,
and consequentiy no Foundation for such an Application of the
Word Divinatio. If we read Divinitas, for Divinatio, the Senio
wilt be then what I ha've expreiird in my Transsationo “
